            <p id="MyStory">I am a 17 year old Dominican & Puerto Rican who grew up in the projects living with a single
                <br>mother. I have a passion for dancing and computer technology which some think are two 
                <br>opposite fields. Music and dance let me express myself and let me have fun and makes me happy 
                <br>in any situation. Computer technology has peeked my interest due to the fact that is the way to
                <br>the future and things we can accomplish. Tech has been apart of all things that are apart of
                <br>this world and continues to evolve with new ways of internet service or robotic servants and
                <br>help within shopping markets or just the use of computer in coding. I see myself becoming an IT
                <br>worker or computer technician because i like helping people with problems concerning computer
                <br>technology. When it comes to dancing, I have alot of energy and I use it to my advantge ever since
                <br>I was young I was dancing my mom tells me. I love listening to Hip Hop and R&B that is what I started
                <br>with and I continue to dance to. In my school I am apart of two dance teams. One for Latin dance and
                <br>the other is House dance which is a mixture of different types of dances having to do with Hip Hop
                <br>reggae, soca, vogue, bboying, pop'n'locking and has stunts in it as well which is cool too. I am
                <br>happy to be apart of both of these dance teams as this wiil be my final year in highschool and I will
                <br>try to continue in College. I am a very sociable person and I have alot of couriousity and courage.
                <br>I do alot of crazy things that leave people in shock in a good way but I dont fear most things unless
                <br>it is paranormal activity then that is gonna jump scare the crap out of me. I dont really like movies
                <br>like that because it seems so unrealistic it leads your mind to dream and they end up plaguing your
                <br>which is a bad thing and can lead to multiple nightmares and that is something I don't like to have.
                <br>well this is a short bio about me and I hope I have your interest in the person I am.
